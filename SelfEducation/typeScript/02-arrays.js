var numArray = [1, 2, 3]; // you can tell array what contains inside
var numStrArr = [1, 2, 3, '123']; // or you can not do this, but in your array can take any data
var typicalStrNumArr = [1, 2, 3, '123']; // also you can tell what types of data must contains in your array
var genericNumStrArr = [1, 2, 3, '123']; // also you can use generic 
var tupleNumStrArr = [1, 2, 3, '123']; // also ts have a tuple but i"m not sure that is a good idea
// because you can have a situation that you have array with a lot of elements (for ex. 700+) and so what? you will use tuple
// and write types for all elements?
